# Bazaar-P2P-Network

Bazaar is a for CS677 course project. For this project, a P2P network is to be developed. Leader election algorithm, clock synchronization, heat beat protocol and fault tolerance are implemented in the P2P network.

Project consists of 3 parts. In the part 1, a simple P2P network is built without a super peer(leader). Part 2 required to implement a leader election algorithm and a clock synchronization algorithm(Lamport clock). Part 3 required fault tolerance and implemented heart beat protocol along with a cache consistency model.
Platform:

Python and XML RPC's are used in the project.
